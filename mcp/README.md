## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys and configuration (for MCP and LLM integrations):

```env
# MCP Configuration
MCP_API_KEY=your_mcp_api_key
MCP_ENDPOINT=your_mcp_endpoint_url

# Example:
# MCP_API_KEY=abc123
# MCP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:5000/mcp
```

Both `MCP_API_KEY` and `MCP_ENDPOINT` are required for the MCP adapter to function properly. If these environment variables are not set, the MCP adapter will still initialize but will operate in a degraded mode, returning the original context data without sending it to the MCP endpoint.

### Run the Server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
2. Choose a module and navigate to its directory:
```bash
cd dspy  # or starter or base-framework
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the server:
```bash
# Using the Python -m flag for proper module resolution
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
## Running Tests

Navigate to the specific module directory and run:
```bash
# Using the Python -m flag for proper module resolution
python -m pytest tests
```
5. Test the endpoints:

Core Endpoints:
- Welcome message: GET /
- Health check: GET /health
- List all agents: GET /agents
---

## API Endpoints

### Core Endpoints

- **Welcome Message:** GET `/`
- **Health Check:** GET `/health`
- **List All Agents:** GET `/agents`

### Dedicated Agent Endpoints

- **Dynamic Agent Execution:** GET `/agent/{agent_name}`
  Loads and executes an agent by its file name.

- **Quote Agent:** GET `/agent/quote`
  Returns an inspirational quote.

- **Classifier Agent:** GET `/classifier?INPUT_TEXT=Hello,%20how%20are%20you?`
  Classifies input text into categories with a confidence score.


### MCP Agents

The MCP integration enables advanced context sharing and inter-module communication between agents. These agents showcase different aspects of MCP functionality:

✅ **Calculator Agent**
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates arithmetic expressions with context sharing via MCP.
   - **Features**: Safely evaluates expressions and maintains context between calls.
   - **Endpoint**: POST `/agents/calculator`
   - **Example**: `{"expression": "3 + 4 * 2"}`

✅ **Multi-Step Reasoning Agent**
   - **Purpose**: Iteratively refines a hypothesis through context updates.
   - **Features**: Demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities using MCP for state management.
   - **Endpoint**: POST `/agents/multi_step_reasoning`
   - **Example**: `{"hypothesis": "The Earth is flat"}`

✅ **Workflow Coordinator Agent**
   - **Purpose**: Coordinates and aggregates responses from multiple sub-agents.
   - **Features**: Simulates a workflow where multiple sub-agents contribute to a final decision or report.
   - **Endpoint**: POST `/agents/workflow_coordinator`
   - **Example**: `{}`

✅ **Workflow Decisioning Agent**
   - **Purpose**: Makes intelligent workflow decisions based on task descriptions.
   - **Features**: Selects and executes sub-agents based on keywords in the task description.
   - **Endpoint**: POST `/agents/workflow_decisioning`
   - **Example**: `{"task_description": "Please analyze and report the data"}`

For detailed documentation on MCP integration, see `/docs/MCP_Integration.md`.

## Swagger UI Documentation

The API is fully documented using Swagger UI, which provides an interactive interface for exploring and testing the endpoints. The documentation includes:

- Detailed descriptions of each endpoint
- Request and response schemas
- Example requests and responses
- Categorization of endpoints by tags (e.g., "MCP Agents", "Dspy Agents")

To access the Swagger UI documentation:

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/docs
   ```

The Swagger UI provides a convenient way to test the endpoints directly from the browser, making it easy to understand and use the API.

## Running Tests

Execute the test suite with:

```bash
# Using the Python -m flag for proper module resolution
python -m pytest tests/
```

### Test Suite Overview

The project includes a comprehensive test suite that covers various aspects of the system:

1. **MCP Agent Tests** (`tests/test_mcp_agents.py`):
   - Tests for all MCP agents (calculator, multi-step reasoning, workflow coordinator, workflow decisioning)
   - Verifies correct response structures and functionality
   - Uses mocked MCP adapter for isolated testing

2. **MCP Adapter Tests** (`tests/test_mcp.py`):
   - Tests for the MCPAdapter class
   - Verifies initialization with and without environment variables
   - Tests context sending and response retrieval
   - Tests agent integration with the MCP adapter

3. **DSPy Agent Tests** (`tests/test_dspy_agents.py`):
   - Tests for the classifier agent
   - Verifies correct classification of different types of input
   - Tests error handling for invalid input

4. **Main Application Tests** (`tests/test_main.py`):
   - Tests for core application endpoints
   - Verifies health check and welcome message

5. **Starter Agent Tests** (`tests/test_starter_agents.py`):
   - Tests for basic starter agents

To run specific test files:

```bash
# Run only MCP agent tests
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp_agents.py

# Run only MCP adapter tests
python -m pytest tests/test_mcp.py

# Run only DSPy agent tests
python -m pytest tests/test_dspy_agents.py
```

To run tests with verbose output:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```
